1. ls -  to list directories and files in a particular location.
2. pwd - To check present working directory
3. cd /location- it is used to change the present working directory
4. cd  -  to come back home location directory
5. clear - To wipe up all the previous statement (commands)
6. cd .. -  To come back previous location by one step
7. mkdir - To create your own folder(directory).
 you can create multiple folder together.

(how to change the name of directory that we have ?/)
8. mv : used to rename a folder 
9. mv : This command is also used to move the directory from one location
         to other. ----> folder_name new_location
note- whenever the desired location is present then mv will move it .
     otherwise it will rename the directory name.

10. WE have two commands for creating files \
   1. touch : it will give just blank file
   2. nano :  it will ask for edit , then create the file 

note - if you have already created a file irrespective of touch or nano
, when you want to edit it, go for 'nano' again.
and if you wish to see the content of the file then use 'cat' command

11. cat : to view the content of the file

12. rm - it is used to remove files and directories. By using this commands you
	 can also delete multiple file successivley.

13. unlink - it will only remove 1 file at a time. if you wish to delete
              multiple files at same time then go for 'rm' command

14. rmdir - to remove the directory. Make sure there is nothing inside the directory 
            which you are actually trying to delete

15. rm -d directory name : same as point no. 14

home task --- find out the commands to delete a full packed folder/directory  and implement it also.

16. rm -r foldername -> This commands is used to delete a non empty folder/directory.
  note - 'r' represent recursive

17. rm - removing files
    rmdir - removing empty folder
    rm -r - removing non empty folder

18. cp filename location/ = to copy a file from one location to another

19. cp -r foldername location --> to copy a folder from one location to another

#now we will see some package update/upgrade commands.

note - sudo means, you are having all the admin rights

20. sudo apt-get update - it will update/download the list of available packages in linux

21. sudo apt-get upgrade - it will upgrade/install the list of downloaded packages.

22. sudo apt -get update && sudo apt-get upgrade - you can use both of them simultaneously.

23. sudo apt-get install apache2 --> to install a specific package(e.g. apach22)

24. sudo apt install apache2 - to install a specific package(e.g. apache2)

25. to make sure your linux machine is communicating well with host machine. Type ifconfig in linux, you will get
  ip address. now open command propt in host machine and type 'ping' along with ip address of linux machine.
  If ping is successful means linux machine is communicating well with host machine.

26. uname ----> gives the user name (LINUX)

27. uname -r --> to get info regarding linux version

28. uname -a -> to get more info about linux

29. history -- > to get the history of commands you have used till now

30. man ls ---> you will get all the acronyms commands like -r, -a etc

note - There are two types of directoy we have i.e. root directory and user directory. 
#root directory is present inside user directory.
#it is recommeded to not disturb the files present inside the user directory.
#make a habit of using 'cd' commands before starting with any linux command in terminal.

31. Now we gonna see permission system in files.
There are 3 types defined category we have in linux.

1. admin - > it must have all the permission
2. group -> medium permission might have
3. public -> it has all permission apart from write permission.

#There are three types of permission we have in linux:
read (r)   ----> 4
write  (w) ----> 2
execute (x) ---> 1

Example - change the permission
task :
admin ---> rwx  --> 4+2+1 = 7 
group ---> rw   --> 4+2 =   6
public --> r    --> 4 =     4

So, The sum becomes 764

32. ls -l filename -->  to check the permission of a file 

33. chmod (number combination) filename --> to change the permission of a file
